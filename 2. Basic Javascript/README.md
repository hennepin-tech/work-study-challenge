# Basic Javascript & Node

**Goal: Write some Javascript that adds a click event to ```<div id='box'>```. When the users clicks, the background color should change from red to green.**

## Guidelines

1. The JS should change the elements background color directly and not just apply a class
2. Please use Vanilla JS and not a library like jQuery

## Hints

1. Don't forget that everything in JS is an object!
2. Wait for the window to load
