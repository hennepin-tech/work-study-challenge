# Advanced Javascript and Node.js

**Write a node script that fetches the first 150 pokemon and prints their names to the console** 

## Guidelines

1. This directory already has a package.json file - no need to initialize one
2. Install an external node module package to handle fetching the data
3. Use the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for this challenge
4. Only return the pokemon _names_

## Hints

1. Remember, you're _fetch_-ing from _node_
2. I _promise_ you'll want to _(a)wait_ for the results
